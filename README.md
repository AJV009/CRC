# cycle redundancy check (CRC)
A cycle redundancy check (CRC) in C programming is an error detecting commonly used in storage devices, etc. Block of data is entered and is checked and it is based on if the remainder is 0 or not and if it not found to be zero then an error is detected in the code. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary hardware. CRCs basically are used as xor operation is performed between two numbers if remainder is zero then no error if itâ€™s not zero then error is detected.
